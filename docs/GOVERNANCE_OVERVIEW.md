# Governance Overview (Example Document)

This document provides an example governance structure for the Aurelius Protocol Governance Framework. It is designed for demonstration, portfolio, and educational purposes only. This is not a real protocol or active governance system.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this example governance model is to illustrate how a foundation‑grade governance structure can be documented, organized, and maintained in a professional repository.  
This document establishes the roles, responsibilities, and lifecycle processes that define how changes would be proposed, reviewed, approved, and deployed in a protocol‑level governance system.

## Governance Roles

### **Core Maintainers**
Responsible for reviewing proposals, approving changes, maintaining repository standards, and ensuring documentation quality.

### **Technical Reviewers**
Provide technical validation, architectural review, and security analysis for proposals and implementation changes.

### **Contributors**
Community members who submit proposals, documentation updates, or improvements to the example framework.

## Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Draft**  
   A contributor submits an initial proposal following the AIP template.

2. **Review**  
   Core Maintainers and Technical Reviewers evaluate feasibility, clarity, and security considerations.

3. **Approval**  
   The proposal is accepted, rejected, or returned for revision.

4. **Implementation**  
   Approved proposals are developed, documented, and merged into the repository.

5. **Audit**  
   Security and quality checks are performed to ensure compliance with standards.

6. **Deployment**  
   Final changes are released and documented as part of the governance history.

## Governance Principles

- **Transparency** — All decisions and proposals are publicly documented.  
- **Accountability** — Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined.  
- **Security‑First** — Every change must undergo review and audit.  
- **Documentation Discipline** — All processes must be clearly recorded.  
- **Long‑Term Maintainability** — The structure must support growth and iteration.

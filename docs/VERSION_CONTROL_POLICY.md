# Version Control Policy (Example Document)

This document defines the example version control standards used within the Aurelius Protocol Governance Framework. It is intended for demonstration, portfolio, and educational purposes only. It does not represent a real production‑grade version control policy.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Version Control Policy is to ensure that all changes within this example framework are tracked, auditable, consistent, and aligned with institutional documentation standards.

---

## 2. Version Control Principles

All version control activity must follow these principles:

- **Traceability** — Every change must be linked to a clear purpose  
- **Consistency** — Commit messages and branch names must follow defined standards  
- **Integrity** — History must remain intact and unaltered  
- **Transparency** — All changes must be visible and reviewable  
- **Professionalism** — Version control activity must reflect institutional discipline  

---

## 3. Branching Model (Example)

This example framework uses a simplified branching model:

### 1. `main` Branch
- Primary source of truth  
- Contains only approved and stable content  
- Protected against force‑pushes and direct edits  

### 2. Feature or Document Branches

Named using the pattern:

feature/&lt;short-description&gt;

Examples:
- feature/add-risk-register
- feature/update-governance-overview

Used for:
- New documents  
- Major updates  
- Structural changes  

---

## 4. Commit Message Standards

Commit messages must be:

- Clear  
- Factual  
- Neutral  
- Free of emojis  
- Lowercase prefix  
- Short and descriptive  

### Format

&lt;prefix&gt;: &lt;short description&gt;

### Accepted Prefixes (Example)

- docs: Documentation changes  
- fix: Corrections  
- update: Improvements  
- refactor: Structural adjustments  

Extended descriptions must be used for major changes.

---

## 5. Release Structure (Example)

Releases represent major milestones in the example framework.

### Release Format

v&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;

Examples:
- v1.0.0 — Initial example release  
- v1.1.0 — Added new governance components  
- v1.1.1 — Minor documentation corrections  

---

## 6. History Protection Rules

To maintain auditability:

- No force‑pushes to `main`  
- No history rewrites  
- No deletion of approved branches without review  
- All merges must be performed through pull requests  

---

## 7. Review Requirements

- Minor changes may be committed directly  
- Moderate changes require review by a Core Maintainer  
- Major changes require full review and approval  
- All changes must follow the Change Control process  

---

## 8. Disclaimer

This Version Control Policy is an **example framework** created for educational and portfolio purposes.  
It does not apply to any real protocol, blockchain, or production environment.

# Documentation Standards (Example Document)

This document defines the example documentation standards used within the Aurelius Protocol Governance Framework. It is intended for demonstration, portfolio, and educational purposes only. It does not represent a real production‑grade documentation standard.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of these Documentation Standards is to ensure that all documents within this example framework are clear, consistent, structured, and aligned with institutional governance requirements.

---

## 2. Documentation Principles

All documentation must follow these principles:

- **Clarity** — Information must be easy to understand  
- **Consistency** — Formatting, structure, and terminology must be uniform  
- **Neutrality** — Tone must remain factual and professional  
- **Completeness** — No missing sections or placeholders  
- **Auditability** — All documents must be traceable and properly versioned  

---

## 3. Document Structure Requirements

All documents must follow a consistent structure:

### Required Sections
- Title  
- Purpose  
- Scope (when applicable)  
- Standards, rules, or procedures  
- Disclaimer  
- Signature block  

### Optional Sections
- Definitions  
- Examples  
- References  
- Appendices  

### Formatting Rules
- Use \`#\` for main titles  
- Use \`##\` for primary sections  
- Use \`###\` for subsections  
- Avoid deeper levels unless necessary  

---

## 4. Formatting Standards

### Headings
- Must follow hierarchical order  
- Must not skip levels  
- Must be concise and descriptive  

### Lists
- Use \`-\` for bullet points  
- Use \`1.\` for ordered steps  
- Avoid nested lists unless required  

### Code Blocks
Use fenced blocks for commands, patterns, or templates:

\`\`\`
example code block
\`\`\`

### Inline Elements
Use backticks for inline references:

\`example-inline\`

## 5. Terminology Standards

All documents must use:

- Neutral and factual language  
- Consistent terminology across the framework

## 7. Link and Reference Standards

All links must:

- Be valid and functional

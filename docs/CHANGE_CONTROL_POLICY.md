# Change Control Policy (Example Document)

This document defines the example change control standards used within the Aurelius Protocol Governance Framework. It is intended for demonstration, portfolio, and educational purposes only. It does not represent a real production‑grade change control policy.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Change Control Policy is to ensure that all modifications within this example framework are evaluated, approved, documented, and implemented in a controlled and auditable manner.

---

## 2. Change Control Principles

All changes must follow these principles:

- **Traceability** — Every change must be linked to a documented purpose  
- **Reviewability** — All changes must undergo appropriate review  
- **Consistency** — Changes must align with governance and documentation standards  
- **Auditability** — All changes must be recorded and verifiable  
- **Risk Awareness** — Changes must be evaluated for potential impact  

---

## 3. Change Categories

Changes are classified into three categories:

### 1. Minor Changes
- Typographical corrections  
- Formatting adjustments  
- Clarifications without altering meaning  
- No structural or governance impact  

### 2. Moderate Changes
- Section updates  
- Document restructuring  
- Additions that do not alter governance  

### 3. Major Changes
- New documents  
- Governance modifications  
- Structural reorganizations  
- Changes affecting multiple components  

---

## 4. Change Request Workflow

All changes must follow this workflow:

### Step 1 — Identify the Change
The contributor documents:
- Purpose of the change  
- Category (minor, moderate, major)  
- Affected documents  

### Step 2 — Create a Feature Branch
Branches must follow the pattern:

feature/&lt;short-description&gt;

Examples:
- feature/update-governance-overview  
- feature/add-quality-metrics  

### Step 3 — Implement the Change
Contributors must:
- Follow documentation standards  
- Maintain consistent formatting  
- Avoid unrelated modifications  
- Use clear commit messages  

### Step 4 — Submit a Change Request (Pull Request)
The pull request must include:
- Summary of the change  
- Justification  
- Category classification  
- Confirmation of compliance with standards  

### Step 5 — Review and Approval
- Minor changes: quick review  
- Moderate changes: maintainer review  
- Major changes: full governance review  

### Step 6 — Merge and Document
Once approved:
- Merge into `main`  
- Update release notes if applicable  
- Ensure versioning is consistent  

---

## 5. Approval Requirements

### Minor Changes
Approved by:
- Any reviewer or maintainer  

### Moderate Changes
Approved by:
- Core Maintainer  

### Major Changes
Approved by:
- Governance Maintainers  
- Additional reviewers when required  

---

## 6. Change Documentation Requirements

Every change must include:

- Clear commit messages  
- Updated version numbers when applicable  
- Updated release notes for moderate and major changes  
- No missing context or placeholders  

---

## 7. Prohibited Change Practices

The following actions are not allowed:

- Force‑pushes or history rewrites  
- Introducing unrelated changes in the same PR  
- Modifying governance without approval  
- Submitting incomplete or unclear documentation  
- Bypassing review or approval processes  

---

## 8. Disclaimer

It does not apply to any real protocol, blockchain, or production environment.

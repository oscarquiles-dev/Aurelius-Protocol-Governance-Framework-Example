# Security Policy (Example Document)

This document outlines the example security practices and responsibilities for the Aurelius Protocol Governance Framework. It is intended for demonstration, portfolio, and educational purposes only. It does not represent a real protocol, security program, or production‑grade system.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Security Policy is to define the example security expectations, reporting procedures, and review processes used within this repository.  
These guidelines illustrate how a foundation‑grade project would document its security posture in a transparent and auditable manner.

---

## 2. Security Responsibilities

### Core Maintainers
- Review security‑related proposals and changes  
- Ensure documentation and code follow security best practices  
- Coordinate example audits and reviews  

### Technical Reviewers
- Perform technical and architectural security evaluations  
- Identify potential risks in proposals or implementation  
- Recommend mitigations and improvements  

### Contributors
- Follow secure coding practices  
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly  
- Avoid introducing unsafe patterns

## 3. Vulnerability Reporting (Example Process)

Although this is an example project, the following reporting structure is provided to demonstrate professional standards:

1. Submit a private report via the designated security contact (example only).  
2. Core Maintainers acknowledge the report and begin evaluation.  
3. Technical Reviewers assess severity and potential impact.  
4. A remediation plan is drafted and documented.  
5. A patch is prepared, reviewed, and merged.  
6. A post‑remediation summary is added to the repository.

This process mirrors real open‑source security workflows but is not tied to an active system.

---

## 4. Security Review Requirements

All significant changes should undergo:

- Code review  
- Documentation review  
- Security analysis  
- Dependency evaluation  
- Example audit steps  

These requirements ensure consistency and demonstrate how a real protocol would maintain security discipline.

## 5. Disclaimer

This Security Policy is an **example document** created for educational and portfolio purposes.  
It does not apply to any real protocol, blockchain, or production environment.

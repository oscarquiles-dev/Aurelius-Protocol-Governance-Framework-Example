## 4. Change Control Process

### Step 1 — Proposal or Identification  
A change is proposed through documentation updates or a formal proposal.

### Step 2 — Classification  
The change is categorized as Minor, Moderate, or Major.

### Step 3 — Review  
Reviewers evaluate the change based on:
- Accuracy  
- Impact  
- Alignment with standards  
- Governance implications  

### Step 4 — Approval  
Approval requirements depend on the change type.

### Step 5 — Implementation  
Changes are implemented through version‑controlled commits.

### Step 6 — Documentation  
All changes must be documented through:
- Commit messages  
- Proposal updates (if applicable)  
- Revision history  

---

## 5. Version Control Requirements

- All changes must be committed with clear, factual commit messages  
- Major changes require extended descriptions  
- Commit history must remain intact and auditable  
- No force‑pushes or history rewrites in main branches  

---

## 6. Roles in Change Control

- **Core Maintainers** approve moderate and major changes  
- **Governance Reviewers** evaluate governance‑related changes  
- **Technical Reviewers** evaluate technical implications  
- **Contributors** submit changes and address feedback

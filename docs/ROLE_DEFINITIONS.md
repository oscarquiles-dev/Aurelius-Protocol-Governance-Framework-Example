# Role Definitions (Example Document)

This document defines the example roles and responsibilities within the Aurelius Protocol Governance Framework. It is intended for demonstration, portfolio, and educational purposes only. It does not represent a real organizational structure or production‑grade governance model.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to establish clear, auditable, and well‑defined roles that support governance, technical review, documentation quality, and decision‑making processes within this example framework.

---

## 2. Core Roles

### 1. Core Maintainers
Core Maintainers are responsible for the long‑term direction, integrity, and consistency of the framework.

**Responsibilities:**
- Oversee governance and documentation standards  
- Approve proposals after review  
- Coordinate example audits and evaluations  
- Maintain repository structure and quality  

---

### 2. Technical Reviewers
Technical Reviewers evaluate proposals, documents, and example modules for correctness, feasibility, and alignment with technical standards.

**Responsibilities:**
- Perform technical assessments  
- Identify risks and inconsistencies  
- Recommend improvements  
- Validate implementation steps  

---

### 3. Governance Reviewers
Governance Reviewers ensure that proposals and processes align with governance principles and decision‑making rules.

**Responsibilities:**
- Review proposal structure and clarity  
- Confirm alignment with governance guidelines  
- Evaluate decision‑making logic  
- Provide feedback on process improvements  

---

### 4. Contributors
Contributors participate by submitting proposals, documentation updates, or improvements to the example framework.

**Responsibilities:**
- Follow documentation and technical standards  
- Submit clear and well‑structured proposals  
- Address reviewer feedback  
- Maintain transparency in revisions  

---

### 5. Observers
Observers are non‑participating members who follow the governance process for educational or informational purposes.

**Responsibilities:**
- Review public documentation  
- Learn from governance and audit workflows  
- Provide optional feedback or suggestions  

---

## 3. Role Assignment (Example)

In this example framework, roles are not tied to real individuals.  
Assignments are conceptual and intended to demonstrate how a protocol might structure responsibilities.

A real protocol would include:
- Formal onboarding  
- Role rotation or elections  
- Accountability mechanisms  
- Public role registries  

---

## 4. Role Interaction Model

- Core Maintainers coordinate with Technical and Governance Reviewers  
- Reviewers provide structured feedback to Contributors  
- Contributors revise proposals and documentation  
- Observers follow the process without direct participation  

This model ensures clarity, transparency, and separation of responsibilities.

## 5. Disclaimer

These role definitions are **example guidelines** created for educational and portfolio purposes.  
They do not apply to any real protocol, blockchain, or production environment.

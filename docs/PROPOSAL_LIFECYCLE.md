# Proposal Lifecycle (Example Document)

This document outlines the example lifecycle of proposals within the Aurelius Protocol Governance Framework. It is intended for demonstration, portfolio, and educational purposes only. It does not represent a real proposal system or production‑grade governance process.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Proposal Lifecycle is to define a clear, auditable, and structured process for creating, reviewing, approving, implementing, and archiving proposals.  
This example demonstrates how a foundation‑grade protocol maintains transparency and consistency in decision‑making.

---

## 2. Proposal Stages

### 1. Draft
A contributor prepares an initial version of the proposal.  
The draft must follow the Technical Standards and include all required sections.

### 2. Review
Core Maintainers and Technical Reviewers evaluate the proposal for:
- Clarity  
- Technical feasibility  
- Governance alignment  
- Security considerations  

Feedback is documented and revisions may be requested.

### 3. Approval
Once reviewers confirm readiness, the proposal moves to the approval stage.  
In a real protocol, this may involve voting or multi‑party authorization.  
In this example, approval is recorded through documentation and commit history.

### 4. Implementation
Approved proposals are implemented according to the specification.  
Implementation steps must be documented, and any changes must follow versioning standards.

### 5. Verification
Reviewers confirm that the implementation matches the approved specification.  
Any deviations must be documented and corrected.

### 6. Archival
Completed proposals are archived for historical reference.  
Archived proposals remain accessible but are no longer active.

## 3. Required Proposal Structure

Each proposal must include:

- Title  
- Summary  
- Motivation  
- Specification  
- Risks and considerations  
- Implementation plan  
- Reviewers  
- Status  
- Revision history  

This structure ensures clarity and consistency across all proposals.

---

## 4. Status Definitions (Example)

- **Draft** — Proposal is being written and refined  
- **In Review** — Reviewers are evaluating the proposal  
- **Approved** — Proposal has passed review and is authorized  
- **Implemented** — Proposal has been executed  
- **Archived** — Proposal is complete and stored for reference  

---

## 5. Revision Requirements

- All revisions must be documented in the proposal’s revision history  
- Major changes require reviewer acknowledgment  
- Minor edits (grammar, formatting) may be committed directly but must remain traceable  

---

## 6. Disclaimer

This Proposal Lifecycle is an **example document** created for educational and portfolio purposes.  
It does not apply to any real protocol, blockchain, or production environment.

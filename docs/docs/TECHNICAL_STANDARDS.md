# Technical Standards (Example Document)

This document defines the example technical standards used within the Aurelius Protocol Governance Framework. These standards are provided for demonstration and portfolio purposes only and do not represent requirements for a real protocol or production system.

---

## 1. Code Quality Principles

All example modules included in this repository follow these principles:

- **Clarity** — Code should be easy to read and understand.
- **Modularity** — Components should be organized into logical units.
- **Consistency** — Naming conventions and structure should remain uniform.
- **Documentation** — Every module must include clear comments and references.
- **Security Awareness** — Code should avoid unsafe patterns and highlight potential risks.

These principles mirror the expectations of modern open‑source foundations.

---

## 2. Repository Structure Standards

The repository follows a foundation‑grade structure:

- `/docs` — Governance, standards, and whitepaper documents  
- `/proposals` — Aurelius Improvement Proposals (AIPs)  
- `/src` — Example reference implementation modules  
- `/tests` — Example test suite  
- `/.github` — Issue templates, PR templates, and workflows  

This structure is designed to demonstrate maintainability and audit‑readiness.

---

## 3. Naming Conventions

- Files use **kebab-case** or **snake_case** depending on language.
- Directories use **kebab-case**.
- Proposal files follow the format:  
  `AIP-XXXX-title.md`
- Modules follow descriptive names such as:  
  `example_module.rs`, `hashing.rs`

---

## 4. Documentation Requirements

Every important file must include:

- A clear title  
- A purpose section  
- Version or status information  
- A disclaimer indicating this is an example project  
- The official signature block  

---

## 5. Disclaimer

These technical standards are **example guidelines** created for educational and portfolio purposes. They do not apply to any real protocol or production environment.

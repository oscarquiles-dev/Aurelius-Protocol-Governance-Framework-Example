# Risk Management (Example Document)

This document outlines the example risk management framework used within the Aurelius Protocol Governance Framework. It is intended for demonstration, portfolio, and educational purposes only. It does not represent a real risk program or production‑grade system.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Risk Management document is to define a structured, auditable, and transparent approach for identifying, evaluating, mitigating, and monitoring risks within this example governance framework.

---

## 2. Risk Categories (Example)

The following categories represent common areas of risk in governance and technical systems:

### 1. Governance Risks
- Ambiguous decision‑making processes  
- Insufficient reviewer participation  
- Conflicts of interest  
- Lack of documentation or transparency  

### 2. Technical Risks
- Incomplete specifications  
- Implementation inconsistencies  
- Security vulnerabilities  
- Dependency failures  

### 3. Operational Risks
- Process delays  
- Miscommunication between roles  
- Inaccurate documentation updates  
- Lack of version control discipline  

### 4. Compliance Risks
- Failure to follow internal standards  
- Missing audit requirements  
- Untracked changes or undocumented decisions  

---

## 3. Risk Management Process

### Step 1 — Identification  
Risks are identified during proposal drafting, technical review, audits, or documentation updates.

### Step 2 — Evaluation  
Each risk is evaluated based on:
- Likelihood  
- Impact  
- Scope  
- Mitigation difficulty  

### Step 3 — Mitigation  
Mitigation strategies may include:
- Clarifying documentation  
- Revising proposals  
- Adding reviewer steps  
- Strengthening security considerations  

### Step 4 — Monitoring  
Risks are monitored through:
- Proposal lifecycle checkpoints  
- Audit reviews  
- Version control history  
- Contributor feedback

## 4. Risk Register (Example Structure)

A real protocol would maintain a formal risk register.  
This example provides a simplified structure:

| Risk ID | Category | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|--------|------------|--------|
| R‑001 | Governance | Proposal lacks clarity | Medium | Medium | Add reviewer feedback loop | Open |
| R‑002 | Technical | Specification incomplete | High | High | Require revision before approval | In Review |
| R‑003 | Operational | Delayed documentation updates | Low | Medium | Enforce versioning standards | Mitigated |

---

## 5. Roles in Risk Management

- **Core Maintainers** oversee risk evaluation and ensure mitigation steps are followed  
- **Technical Reviewers** identify technical and security risks  
- **Governance Reviewers** identify process and decision‑making risks  
- **Contributors** must address risks identified during review  
- **Observers** may provide optional feedback

## 6. Disclaimer

This Risk Management document is an **example framework** created for educational and portfolio purposes.  
It does not apply to any real protocol, blockchain, or production environment.

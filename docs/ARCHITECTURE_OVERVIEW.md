# Architecture Overview — Aurelius Protocol Governance Framework (Example Repository)

This document provides a high‑level architectural overview of the Aurelius Protocol Governance Framework Example. It explains how the governance components interact, how documentation layers are structured, and how decision‑making, compliance, and operational integrity are modeled within this educational framework.  
This is not a production governance system.

---

## 1. Governance Architecture Model

The governance framework is organized into five core architectural layers:

### 1.1 Governance Structure Layer
Defines the organizational model, roles, responsibilities, and communication standards.

Key documents:
- [GOVERNANCE_OVERVIEW.md](./GOVERNANCE_OVERVIEW.md)
- [ROLE_DEFINITIONS.md](./ROLE_DEFINITIONS.md)
- [COMMUNICATION_STANDARDS.md](./COMMUNICATION_STANDARDS.md)

This layer establishes authority, accountability, and information flow.

---

### 1.2 Control and Compliance Layer
Provides the mechanisms for managing change, ensuring consistency, and maintaining auditability.

Key documents:
- [VERSION_CONTROL_POLICY.md](./VERSION_CONTROL_POLICY.md)
- [CHANGE_CONTROL.md](./CHANGE_CONTROL.md)
- [CHANGE_CONTROL_POLICY.md](./CHANGE_CONTROL_POLICY.md)
- [RELEASE_MANAGEMENT.md](./RELEASE_MANAGEMENT.md)
- [AUDIT_PROCESS.md](./AUDIT_PROCESS.md)

This layer ensures that all modifications follow controlled, traceable, and reviewable processes.

---

### 1.3 Documentation and Quality Layer
Defines the standards for clarity, structure, terminology, and technical expectations.

Key documents:
- [DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md](./DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md)
- [QUALITY_ASSURANCE_POLICY.md](./QUALITY_ASSURANCE_POLICY.md)
- [TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md](./TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md)

This layer ensures that all documents meet institutional‑grade quality requirements.

---

### 1.4 Conduct and Contribution Layer
Establishes behavioral expectations and contribution workflows.

Key documents:
- [CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.md](./CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.md)
- [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [COMMUNICATION_STANDARDS.md](./COMMUNICATION_STANDARDS.md)

This layer governs collaboration, professionalism, and repository hygiene.

---

### 1.5 Risk and Security Layer
Models operational integrity, risk mitigation, and security expectations.

Key documents:
- [RISK_MANAGEMENT.md](./RISK_MANAGEMENT.md)
- [SECURITY_POLICY.md](./SECURITY_POLICY.md)

This layer ensures that governance decisions consider risk exposure and security posture.

---

## 2. Proposal Lifecycle Architecture

The proposal process is modeled as a structured, multi‑stage workflow:

1. Drafting — Initial creation and documentation  
2. Review — Internal evaluation and feedback  
3. Assessment — Risk, quality, and compliance checks  
4. Approval — Formal decision‑making  
5. Implementation — Execution and versioning  
6. Post‑Review — Audit and retrospective analysis  

Key document:
- [PROPOSAL_LIFECYCLE.md](./PROPOSAL_LIFECYCLE.md)

This architecture ensures transparency, traceability, and controlled decision‑making.

---

## 3. Repository Architecture

The repository follows a clean, audit‑ready structure:

/
├── README.md  
├── docs/  
│   ├── GOVERNANCE_OVERVIEW.md  
│   ├── ROLE_DEFINITIONS.md  
│   ├── COMMUNICATION_STANDARDS.md  
│   ├── VERSION_CONTROL_POLICY.md  
│   ├── CHANGE_CONTROL.md  
│   ├── CHANGE_CONTROL_POLICY.md  
│   ├── RELEASE_MANAGEMENT.md  
│   ├── AUDIT_PROCESS.md  
│   ├── DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md  
│   ├── QUALITY_ASSURANCE_POLICY.md  
│   ├── TECHNICAL_STANDARDS.md  
│   ├── CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.md  
│   ├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md  
│   ├── RISK_MANAGEMENT.md  
│   ├── SECURITY_POLICY.md  
│   ├── PROPOSAL_LIFECYCLE.md  
│   ├── INDEX.md  
│   └── SUMMARY.md  

This structure ensures:

- Predictable navigation  
- Clear categorization  
- Zero ambiguity  
- Audit‑friendly organization

## 4. Architectural Principles

The framework is built on the following principles:

### 4.1 Transparency
All processes, roles, and decisions are documented and accessible.

### 4.2 Traceability
Every change, proposal, and decision can be traced through version control and documentation.

### 4.3 Consistency
Standards ensure uniformity across documents and processes.

### 4.4 Accountability
Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined and enforced.

### 4.5 Auditability
Policies and workflows support internal and external audits.

---

## 5. Scope and Limitations

This architecture:

- Models governance concepts for educational and portfolio purposes  
- Does not represent a real protocol or production system  
- Is not intended for deployment in operational environments

# Audit Process (Example Document)

This document outlines the example audit workflow used within the Aurelius Protocol Governance Framework. It is intended for demonstration, portfolio, and educational purposes only. It does not represent a real audit program or production‑grade system.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Audit Process is to demonstrate how a foundation‑grade protocol would structure internal reviews, technical evaluations, and governance‑aligned audits.  
This example provides transparency, consistency, and a clear reference for contributors.

- Logical correctness  
- Security considerations  
- Consistency with technical standards  
- Maintainability

## 3. Audit Workflow (Example)

1. **Audit Request**  
   A maintainer or contributor submits an audit request.

2. **Scope Definition**  
   Core Maintainers define what will be reviewed (documentation, code, proposals, etc.).

3. **Reviewer Assignment**  
   Technical Reviewers or Governance Reviewers are assigned depending on the scope.

4. **Evaluation Phase**  
   Reviewers analyze the materials, identify issues, and document findings.

5. **Report Drafting**  
   A structured audit report is created, including:
   - Summary  
   - Findings  
   - Severity levels  
   - Recommendations  

6. **Remediation**  
   Contributors address findings and submit updates.

7. **Verification**  
   Reviewers confirm that issues have been resolved.

8. **Finalization**  
   The audit is marked as complete and archived for reference.

## 4. Audit Report Structure (Example)

An audit report should include:

- Title  
- Date  
- Scope  
- Reviewers  
- Summary of findings  
- Detailed findings  
- Recommendations  
- Status (Open, In Review, Resolved)  

This structure mirrors real‑world audit documentation standards.
